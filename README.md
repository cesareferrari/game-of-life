# Conway's Game of life

## What are cellular automata and how they are useful in real life

Cellular automata are a simulation of a universe divided into cells.
Each cell has a finite number of states (ex.: on/off) that changes based on
strict rules.
Each cell also has neighbors, cells that surround it.  

Cells start in an initial state and state is changed simultaneously for all
cells to create successive generations.

Cellular automata are useful in computer processors and cryptography.


## Analyze the ‘Turing Completeness’ of Conway’s “Game of Life”

A system of data-manipulation rules is said to be Turing complete if it can be
used to simulate a Turing machine.
A Turing machine is a matematical device that has 
- a tape, divided into discrete cells, to hold input data and store results, 
- a read/write head which reads and writes symbols on the tape, 
- and a set of rules.

The Game of life has the same structure, a grid of cells, a way to read and
write the cell state, and a set of rules.


## Implement a visualization of Conway’s “Game of Life” using technologies related to their specific track.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
